# Battle Rezponder WoW Addon

![Battle Rezponder icon](images/BattleRezponder-icon.png)

Automatically respond in chat when someone in your party or raid asks for a Battle Rez.

Are your party members asking to be resurrected in the middle of an encounter, but you can't risk of typing a response? Battle Rezponder will automatically detect when a battle rez is requested in party, raid, /say, or /yell chat and respond in the appropriate party/raid channel with the battle rez spell's remaining cooldown time.

Currently there are no configuration options. The plugin will auto-detect whether you're playing a class with a battle rez spell and enable/disable the response. It also works with Hunters to detect if their currently active pet can battle rez.

TODO:

- Detect when multiple players are running the addon that can battle rez so only one chat response is sent.
- Add configuration options for output formatting and channels.
